This tool should allow you to run the program and make a react project for you. will install all necessary items and remove everything you won't need for basic React-App functionality.
### TO DO:
- [ ] Remove unused modules in create-react-app framework such as webhooks, the react logo, etc.
- [ ] Add an auto install script for NPM packages in a npm.json skeleton. Will need to add ``npm i && cd client && npm i && cd src && npm i``
- [ ] Upload package.json and clone repo in separate dir to test install scripts, the above may need to be reversed with ``cd src`` before ``cd client``
- [ ] etc
- [x] put an x in the box to mark as checked
